# UI_WeatherAPP

This project contains simple Python program that reads temperature, humidity and air pressure data via Sense Hat sensors and sends it to
MySQL Database that runs on Azure.

Project also contains C# UWP application, that reads the data from the MySQL database and presents it to the user. On UI there is implemented
basic search functions. This project was more about learning the UWP and different controls of it so it is not by any means using best possible
UI elements to present the data.
